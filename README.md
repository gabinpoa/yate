# Yate (in development)

To run it in your machine you need to get Love (from your distro repository or the official [AppImage](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/download/11.5/love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage)). Then either download the release .love file or clone this repository. If you cloned this repo, run Love with the path to the repository directory as an argument  
Ex: `/[yourpath]/love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage .` or `love .`  
Else if you downloaded the release .love file, run Love with the path to the .love file as an argument  
Ex: `/[yourpath]/love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage ./yate.love` or `love ./yate.love`
